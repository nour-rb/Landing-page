# Landing-page
README
-This is my attempt at creating an entire website as an exercise that was provided to me by The Odin Project.

-This is the first real website I’ve built from the ground up.

-It took me a week (overall, I’d say about 10 hours). It was really fun, and it confirmed my passion and love for designing websites.

-I know it's not perfect, i couldn't figure out container 04 and some of the flex properties but i learned so much and now i have a pretty good idea about what i should focus on more, i'm sure next time will be better.
